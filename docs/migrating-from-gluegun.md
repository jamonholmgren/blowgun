# Migrating from Gluegun

Currently, I do NOT recommend migrating from [Gluegun](https://github.com/infinitered/gluegun).

I am still working on Bluebun, and it is not yet ready for production use. There's a lot of functionality missing.

In the future, it _may_ be worth migrating, but realize that you would only be supporting Bun and not Node. Gluegun supports both.

Bluebun is very specifically for people who want to use Bun. If you want to use Node, you should use Gluegun.

In the future, I will flesh out a guide here for the migration. If you want to help with that, I would very much appreciate it. Just file an issue and I'll help you!
