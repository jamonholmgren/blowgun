# Reference

Bluebun comes with a number of built-in utilities that are useful for most CLIs. They're all exported from `bluebun` directly, so you can import them like this:

```typescript
import { inputKey } from "bluebun"
```

Each of the following docs has usage examples and a Testing section that gives examples on how to write tests for them.

## CLI

- [run](./reference/run.md) - run the CLI and command
- [cli](./reference/cli.md) - start the CLI without running the command

## User Interaction

- [ask](./reference/ask.md)
- [cursor](./reference/cursor.md)
- [inputKey](./reference/inputKey.md)

## Output

- [print](./reference/print.md)
- [spinner](./reference/spinner.md)
- [styles and colors](./reference/styles.md)
